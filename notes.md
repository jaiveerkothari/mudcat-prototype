Currently this page does not have a backend. The operators are hardcoded in the html. We need functionality where we can add sensors, transformers and other types of compoenents without having to touch the html.

The json to xml pipeline is under construction. Being written in python but might have to convert that into a js function or script. This would then spit out an xml pipeline ready to run by SSI.

In the future there should be a way to send the xml pipeline to SSI. i.e. link the web front end to the SSI Back end.
