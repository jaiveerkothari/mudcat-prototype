MUDCAT - Multimodal Data Capture and Analysis Tool
Developed as part of a project at the TIILT Lab at Northwestern University.

Mudcat is a tool to make multimodal data capture and analysis easier for researchers. The goal is to develop an interface that allows one to choose what sensors to use and what pipeline to setup for the data capture. 

Currently, we are building  a drag and drop UI for the web application.
